Overview
Last Man Standing (LMS) is a minigame where players fight to the death and the last man standing wins the game.

This is how the plugin works:
First of all, players perform the command /lms join in order to join the LMS. In order to join the LMS, players need to have the amount of entry fees (optional). Their data (armor, level, health, hunger, location etc.) are stored. Then, they will be sent to the LMS lobby.

In the lobby, players can vote for the LMS kits using the command /lms vote. When there is a certain number of players in the lobby, the lobby timer starts. Players are able to join the lobby until the lobby contains the maximum number of players allowed. Once the timer ends, players are teleported to the game at their individual spawns (depending on the sequence of the players who joined the LMS lobby. The entry fees are taken from the players' account once they are teleported to the game (optional).

When the players are teleported in their individual spawns, they are also given the kit which has the highest vote count. If more than one kit have the most vote count, or no players have voted, a random kit is chosen among the kits which have the highest vote count. Players are invincible and not allowed to move until the starting timer ends.

Players are now able to move and PVP is enabled. Players can now fight to the death. Players are rewarded for killing and eliminating other players from the LMS (configurable). Players that are eliminated will be teleported back to their original location and their data are restored.

The last man standing wins the LMS and is rewarded (configurable). The winning player is also rewarded the sum of entry fees of the players who have joined the game (optional). Fireworks are spawned around the winner for a configurable duration of time before the game ends. After the game ends, the winner is teleported to their original location and their data are restored. The LMS is joinable again.

Features

- Bug free unlike other minigame plugins (e.g. when server restarts, players are teleported back to their original location and their data are restored)

What Makes This Plugin Worth the $
- I have searched all over the internet and could not find a fully working LMS minigame plugin.
- Very little to no bugs. Minigame plugins are tricky to handle and might contain lots of bugs during first release. However, I have checked through the code and tested the plugin multiple times. I can assure that there is not bugs but I cannot 100% guarantee that there is none.
- I put my passion in my work.
- The plugin itself is very configurable.
- Plenty of features are coming soon.
